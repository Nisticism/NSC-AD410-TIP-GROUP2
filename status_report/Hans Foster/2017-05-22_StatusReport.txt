1)  Ended up missing today (Monday's meeting) but wanted to work on filters - have identified some challenges already

2)  Will write more finalized SQL queries to upload to github that should represent how we search the database 
each time a query is made.  

3)  Only that I am missing today's meeting and will unfortunately miss next week too.
