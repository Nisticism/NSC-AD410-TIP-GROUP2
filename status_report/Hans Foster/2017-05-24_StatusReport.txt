1)  Had a good discussion with Joseph and generated some pseudo-code with him for the filters.  
Particularly we talked about how to check for quiz completeness and searching for incomplete quizzes.

2)  Will try to work more on the pseudo code to turn it into actual code.

3)  Can't attend next week.
