Yesterday

worked on Justin's json file


Today

worked on Justin's json file

updated db with a newly created survey based on the example one given to us by Paul. the previous quiz I made had the question in the name field. this lead to problems with some json queries, so i returned it to the title field. the name field now autopopulates again with a default name ("question" plus a number)


Roadblocks

Justin's json file. i feel i have spent way too much time on it. what i get done tonite will be what he gets. i have other things to do so soeone else will have to edit my work or start from scratch(dont do that!)
