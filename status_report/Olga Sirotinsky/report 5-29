status report for 5/29/2017

1) completed pie charts but changed the library. No longer using d3.js 

2) will continue working on galaxy chart. 

3) galaxy chart requires csv file of data. Tryng to find a easier way to retrieve data instead of using csv file. 
May have to use different type of chart or figure out how to export data into csv?
