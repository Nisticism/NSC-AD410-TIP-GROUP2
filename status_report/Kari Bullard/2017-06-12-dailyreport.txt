1) Just realized my status report for last wednesday wasn't anywhere... and I was unable to submit one for last Friday, however, I was unable to get a lot done since I had my sister's wedding to attend to, soooo....today I am working on finishing the report export functionality. 

2) Tomorrow I plan on seeing what else needs to be done.

3) No roadblocks at this exact moment, but I'll reach out if I encounter anything.
