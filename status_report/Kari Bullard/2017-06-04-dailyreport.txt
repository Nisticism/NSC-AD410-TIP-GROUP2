1) Yesterday I worked on combining the report export tools with the files Olga made. 

2) Today and tomorrow I plan on continuing that.

3) Wondering if someone from mid-tier could write db scripts to get the data necessary for the reports. I would just need to be able to make calls to it, or have the data passed to public/Views/report_preview.php
